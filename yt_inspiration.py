# given a list of channels, return a list of most viewed, most recent, and most liked videos

<think>
Okay, the user wants to retrieve
a list of the most viewed and most liked videos for a YouTube channel
using Python. Let me break down how to approach this.

First, I know that YouTube's API is essential here. So, I'll need to
register an app on Google Cloud Console to get API credentials. The user
will need their own, so I should mention creating a new project and
enabling the YouTube API v3.

Once the API setup is done, I'll use Python's google-api-python-client
library. Importing it as client-secrets makes sense. Then, loading the
API key from environment variables or a file would be necessary to keep
it secure.

Next, constructing the API request for the channel's videos. Using the
YouTubeVideoEndpoint with the channel name and part 'id,snippet' will
give a list of video IDs and details. I'll loop through this response to
extract each video's ID and title.

Separately, retrieving the video statistics is needed for most viewed and
most liked. For most viewed, another API request with maxResults=1,
ordering by viewCount in descending order should work. The top result
will be the most viewed.

For most liked, the same approach applies, using likes as the statistic
and sorting similarly. The video with the highest likes is then
identified.

I'll write two functions: get_most_viewed and get_most_liked. Each
function makes an API request, processes the response, and returns the
video object or None if no results are found.

Finally, I'll compile a list of most viewed and liked videos into a
dictionary and return it to the user. Testing with a sample channel name
will ensure the code works correctly.

I should also remind the user to replace placeholders like
'your-channel-name' and handle any API errors appropriately. Providing
the complete code gives the user a clear starting point.

To retrieve a list of most viewed and most liked videos for a given
YouTube channel using Python, you can use the YouTube Data API v3. Here's
how you can do it step by step:

### Step 1: Set Up the YouTube API
1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**: Go to the [Google Cloud
Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project or
use an existing one.
2. **Enable the YouTube Data API v3**: In the Google Cloud Console, go to
the "APIs & Services" section, select "Library", search for "YouTube Data
API v3", and enable it.
3. **Create App Credentials**: In the "Credentials" section, create new
credentials (e.g., OAuth client or service account) with the necessary
permissions.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment
1. **Install the Google API Client Library**:
   ```bash
   pip install google-api-python-client
   ```
2. **Configure your environment variables**:
   Create a file named `config.json` in your project directory, and add
the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "project_id": "[Your Project ID]",
     "key_filename": "[Path to your key file (if applicable)]",
     "client_email": "[Your client email from Google Cloud Console]",
     "client_id": "[Your client ID from Google Cloud Console]"
   }
   ```
   Make sure `config.json` is in your `.gitignore` file.

### Step 3: Write the Python Code
Here's a sample code to fetch most viewed and liked videos:

```python
from google.api.core import client_secrets
import json

def get_most_viewed(channel_id):
    endpoint = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos"
    parameters = {
        "part": "id,snippet",
        "channel_id": channel_id,
        "maxResults": 1,
        "order": "viewCount desc"
    }

    request = client_secrets.create_request(
        endpoint,
        params=parameters
    )
    response = request.execute()

    if len(response) > 0:
        most_viewed_video = response[0]
        return most_viewed_video
    else:
        return None

def get_most_liked(channel_id):
    endpoint = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos"
    parameters = {
        "part": "id,snippet",
        "channel_id": channel_id,
        "maxResults": 1,
        "order": "likes desc"
    }

    request = client_secrets.create_request(
        endpoint,
        params=parameters
    )
    response = request.execute()

    if len(response) > 0:
        most_liked_video = response[0]
        return most_liked_video
    else:
        return None

def main():
    # Replace 'your-channel-name' with the actual channel ID
    channel_name = "YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME"
    channel_id = channel_name.replace("-", "")  # Convert to lowercase
and remove hyphens

    # Get most viewed video
    most_viewed_video = get_most_viewed(channel_id)

    # Get most liked video
    most_liked_video = get_most_liked(channel_id)

    # Combine the results into a list
    result = {
        "most_viewed": most_viewed_video,
        "most_liked": most_liked_video
    }

    return json.dumps(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(main())
```

### Step 4: Run the Code
1. **Replace placeholders**:
   - Replace `'your-channel-name'` with your actual YouTube channel name.
   - Ensure `channel_id` is correctly formatted as the YouTube channel ID
(no hyphens).

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Step 5: API Key Handling
- If you're using OAuth credentials, make sure to store them securely and
not commit them to version control.
- If you're using a service account, ensure that your service account has
the necessary permissions for the YouTube API.

### Example Output:
The output will be a JSON object containing the most viewed and most
liked videos, including their titles, IDs, and other relevant fields.

### Notes:
- This script assumes that the channel ID is known. If you only have the
channel name (e.g., "youtube.com/channel/UC12345678"), you might need to
parse it correctly.
- The API will return results based on the `maxResults` parameter, which
is set to 1 in this example.

This approach efficiently retrieves the most viewed and liked videos
using the YouTube Data API v3.
